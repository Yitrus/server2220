Memory Access Simulator
=======================

'masim' is a simulator for intensive memory access.  You can use it to test the
performance or behavior of your memory system.


Usage
-----

Please do below:

```
$ make
$ ./masim --help
```


Configuration File
------------------

Data access pattern you want to simulate can be specified via a configuration
file.  By default, 'masim' uses './configs/default' file as the configuration.
The path to the configuration file can be specified as argument.  This
repository contains several default configuration files.  Please refer to those
for usage and format of the file.  'configs/default' would be a good starting
point.
